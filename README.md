## CLI WEATHER APP

Hello, this is a basic weather app which interacts with the user through
the command line, it receives the input

1. Search city
2. History
0. Exit

This is the second project that I build with Node.js, it focuses mainly on expanding some more on the basic knowledge by implementing some more complicated functionalities, namely:
- Consuming APIs (OpenWeather, Mapbox)
- HTTP requests to external servers.
- Axios package
- Mapbox places to get locations by name.
- Using OpenWeather to get the weather from the chosen location.
- Console application with history functionality.
- Environment variables (dotenv package).
